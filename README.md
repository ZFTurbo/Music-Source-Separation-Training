# Music Source Separation Universal Training Code

Repository for training models for music source separation. Repository is based on [kuielab code](https://github.com/kuielab/sdx23/tree/mdx_AB/my_submission/src) for [SDX23 challenge](https://github.com/kuielab/sdx23/tree/mdx_AB/my_submission/src). The main idea of this repository is to create training code, which is easy to modify for experiments. Brought to you by [MVSep.com](https://mvsep.com).

## Models

Model can be chosen with `--model_type` arg.

Available models for training:

* MDX23C based on [KUIELab TFC TDF v3 architecture](https://github.com/kuielab/sdx23/). Key: `mdx23c`.
* Demucs4HT [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08553)]. Key: `htdemucs`.
* VitLarge23 based on [Segmentation Models Pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Key: `segm_models`.
* TorchSeg based on [TorchSeg module](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Key: `torchseg`.
* Band Split RoFormer [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612), [Repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer)] . Key: `bs_roformer`.
* Mel-Band RoFormer [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01809), [Repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer)]. Key: `mel_band_roformer`.
* Swin Upernet [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)] Key: `swin_upernet`.
* BandIt Plus [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02539), [Repository](https://github.com/karnwatcharasupat/bandit)] Key: `bandit`.
* SCNet [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13276), [Official Repository](https://github.com/starrytong/SCNet), [Unofficial Repository](https://github.com/amanteur/SCNet-PyTorch)] Key: `scnet`.
* BandIt v2 [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07275), [Repository](https://github.com/kwatcharasupat/bandit-v2)] Key: `bandit_v2`.
* Apollo [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.08514v1), [Repository](https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo)] Key: `apollo`.
* TS BSMamba2 [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06245), [Repository](https://github.com/baijinglin/TS-BSmamba2)] Key: `bs_mamba2`.

1. **Note 1**: For `segm_models` there are many different encoders is possible. [Look here](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch#encoders-).
2. **Note 2**: Thanks to [@lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains) for recreating the RoFormer models based on papers.
3. **Note 3**: For `torchseg` gives access to more than 800 encoders from `timm` module. It's similar to `segm_models`.

## How to: Train

To train model you need to:

1) Choose model type with option `--model_type`, including: `mdx23c`, `htdemucs`, `segm_models`, `mel_band_roformer`, `bs_roformer`.
2) Choose location of config for model `--config_path` `<config path>`. You can find examples of configs in [configs folder](configs/). Prefixes `config_musdb18_` are examples for [MUSDB18 dataset](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html).
3) If you have a check-point from the same model or from another similar model you can use it with option: `--start_check_point` `<weights path>`
4) Choose path where to store results of training `--results_path` `<results folder path>`

### Training example

```bash
python train.py \
    --model_type mel_band_roformer \
    --config_path configs/config_mel_band_roformer_vocals.yaml \
    --start_check_point results/model.ckpt \
    --results_path results/ \
    --data_path 'datasets/dataset1' 'datasets/dataset2' \
    --valid_path datasets/musdb18hq/test \
    --num_workers 4 \
    --device_ids 0
```

All training parameters are [here](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/train.py#L107).

## How to: Inference

### Inference example

```bash
python inference.py \
    --model_type mdx23c \
    --config_path configs/config_mdx23c_musdb18.yaml \
    --start_check_point results/last_mdx23c.ckpt \
    --input_folder input/wavs/ \
    --store_dir separation_results/
```

All inference parameters are [here](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/inference.py#L123).

## Useful notes

* All batch sizes in config are adjusted to use with single NVIDIA A6000 48GB. If you have less memory please adjust correspodningly in model config `training.batch_size` and `training.gradient_accumulation_steps`.
* It's usually always better to start with old weights even if shapes not fully match. Code supports loading weights for not fully same models (but it must have the same architecture). Training will be much faster.
